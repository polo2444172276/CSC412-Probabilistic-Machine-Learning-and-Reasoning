# Assignment 1
#### Due: 11:59pm Monday, Feb 24

This is the repository for assignment 1. It contains the following files:

* `.gitignore` - tells git to ignore certain kinds of files. This prevents you from submitting the auxiliary files created when producing LaTeX documents.
* `A1.jmd` - the source code used to generate the assignment document, including examples of starter Julia code you may use for your own solutions. Feel free to fill in your answers directly into this file to produce your pdf writeup. Also feel free to try a more traditional workflow by writing your final writeup in a LaTeX `.tex` document, and completing your code in a standard Julia `.jl` file, or translate the starter code into a python `.py`.
* `A1.pdf` - the text of the assignment.
* `Project.toml` - the Julia environment, specifying packages and versions you can use to complete the programming questions. You can activate this environment by opening this project folder, and inside the Julia REPL typing: `] activate .` and `] instantiate`
* `README.md` - the text you are currently reading.
* `make_pdf.jl` - a short Julia script that contains the code used to produce A1.pdf from A1.jmd.

## Submission Instructions

We will be collecting assignments through Github Classroom.

You will receive a link inviting you to complete the assignment. 

Only the files that you successfully `git push` to this repo will be assessed.

Note: If you've already cloned the repo and started the assignment make sure you put your solutions in the repo we've automatically created for you, and that you push your changes to this repo before the due date.
