### Implementing the model

## Load the Data
train_data, test_data = load_binarized_mnist();
train_x, train_label = train_data;
test_x, test_label = test_data;

## Model Dimensionality
Dh = 500
Ddata = 28^2


### TL;DR Flux Documentation
# find more docs here: https://fluxml.ai/Flux.jl/stable/models/basics/
#
# How to make a simple neural network
simple = Chain(Dense(Ddata,Dh, tanh), Dense(Dh, 10, σ))

# Try it on data
simple(train_x)

# write a loss function
classification_loss(x,label) = mean((simple(x) .- Flux.onehotbatch(label,0:9)).^2)

# try it on data and one hot labels
classification_loss(train_x, train_label)

# Take gradients, this uses Zyogte under the hood
# But makes it convenient to take gradients wrt
# the paramters of the model:
θ = Flux.params(simple)

# Note that the first argument still is a function,
# so we make it anonymous with no arguments ()->...
gs = Flux.gradient(
                   ()-> classification_loss(train_x, train_label),
                   θ)

# Equivalently, here's a slightly fancier syntax with "do" blocks:
#
gs = Flux.gradient(θ) do
  loss = classification_loss(train_x,train_label)
  return loss
end


# Gradient optimization:
# ADAM optimizer with default parameters
opt = ADAM()

# update the paramters with gradients
Flux.Optimise.update!(opt,θ,gs)

# Do these in a training loop
# over batches of the data
# model params
θ = Flux.params(simple)
# ADAM optimizer with default parameters
opt = ADAM()
# over batches of the data
for i in 1:10
  for d in batch_data(train_data)
    gs = Flux.gradient(θ) do
      batch_loss = classification_loss(d...)
      return batch_loss
  end
  #
  # update the paramters with gradients
    Flux.Optimise.update!(opt,θ,gs)
  end
  if i%1 == 0 # change 1 to higher number to compute and print less frequently
