# Stochastic Variational Inference in the TrueSkill Model
This is one of the projects in STA414:Probablistic Machine Learning. I implemented a variant of the TrueSkill Model, a player ranking system for competitive games. The true posterior(skill given games) is modelled by Bayesian Inference. The approximated posterior is modelled by a normal Gaussian and we use stochastic variational inference to optimize the approximated posterior.(by sampling and estimating ELBO) Then, inferences such as the probability of winning between two players, the ranking among all players, etc. can be made using the model.
